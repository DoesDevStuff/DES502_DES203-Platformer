Setting up git LFS
Make sure you install git lfs first, then navigate to your local repository
right-click in folder and put in the following command:
$ git lfs install

Updated git hooks.
Git LFS initialized.


-----
then we want to add a gitattributes folder that essentially tracks your larger files to do that command is:
$ git lfs track "*.psd"
Tracking "*.psd"


Here we took example of photoshop files

Modified the gitattributes with a great sample from reference : https://gist.github.com/Srfigie/77b5c15bc5eb61733a74d34d10b3ed87
